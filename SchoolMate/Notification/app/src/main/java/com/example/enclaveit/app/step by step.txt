1. Firebase Message types

Using Firebase Cloud Messaging you can send three types of messages i.e Notification Message, Data Message and message
with both Notification & Data Payload.

1.1 Notification Message:

Notification messages are handled by firebase SDK itself. Typically the notification message contains title, message,
icon etc., These message can be sent from firebase console UI. By sending this kind of messages, you won’t get much
control over the notification. The notification will be shown automatically when the app is in background.

In order to send notification message, you need to use notification key in json data. An example of notification message
is given below.

1.3 Let's start

STEP 1: Setting build.gradle

STEP 2: Create folder raw and contain sound for it.

STEP 3: Create a new app in firebase with name of package: com.example.enclaveit.app


FINAL STEP: Finally we need to modify our main activity to display the incoming messages on the screen.
Open layout file of main activity activity_main.xml and modify the layout as below.

1.4 ANALYSIS:
Open MainActivity.java and do the below necessary changes. Here in onResume() method we are registering the
broadcast receivers. So that this activity gets the push messages and registration id.

displayFirebaseRegId() fetches the firebase registration id from shared preferences and displays it on the screen.
This is just for your references, we don’t use the reg id any where in the app.

When you want to subscribe to any topic, subscribeToTopic() function can be used. When a client app subscribes to a new topic name (one that does not already exist for your Firebase project),
a new topic of that name is created in FCM and any client can subsequently subscribe to it.
